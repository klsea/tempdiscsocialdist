README

Below is a description of each file inside this directory. Most R scripts need to have the value "sample" set to either 1 (for primary sample) or 2 (for replication sample) in order to run.

00_cleaning_data.R - This takes the raw data from Qualtrics, cleans out unnecessary variables, and reverse codes two questions incorrectly coded by experimenters. Generates and saves a clean data file.

01_populate_data_dictionary.R - Populates a data dictionary that explains the variables in the output of 00_cleaning_data.R.

02_manipulation_check.R - This script checks the variables calculated by Qualtrics (and is how we found the experimenter error that is now fixed in 00_cleaning_data.R).

03_graph_demo.R - This script graphs basic demograph data for the samples.

04_graph_temp_disc.R - This script generates the graphs of temporal discounting data corresponding to Figure 1 in the manuscript.

05_td_ancova.R - This script runs the Reward Domain ANCOVA reported in the test.

06_td_age_by_domain.R - This script runs the linear regression analyses reported in the text and generates Tables 1 and 2.

07_graph_social_dist.R - This script graphs the relationship between age and social distancing variables. Figure 3 is generated by this script.

08_social_dist_correlations.R - This script runs the correlations between age and social distancing variables reported in the manuscript.

09_recode_text_answers.R - This script recodes text responses into categories.

10_compare_to_pag.R - This script runs the Sample by Reward Domain ANCOVA reported in the text.

11_graph_sample_comparisons.R - This script generates a graph that corresponds to the Sample by Reward Domain ANCOVA. Figure 2 is generated by this script.

12_racial_differences.R - This script checks for racial differences in social distancing variables.

13_no_social_distance.R - This script recodes the "tattle-tail" question from Sample 2 and examines a histogram of the age of violators.
